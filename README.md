# Razel

Clean up your messy drop boxes. 

I liked the watch functionality of Hazel [[http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php]]
and how I could use it to keep my download folder or desktop clean.

What I didn't like: 

* I hardly use 10% of its functionality but it has a $21 price tag
* It moved into the system settings and into the background tasks

So, just give `razel.rb` a try.
Configure the folders you want to cleanup up, run and enjoy.
Razel just moves every file into a folder with the extension name.
Nothing more.

Oh, yeah: It probably has bugs.
